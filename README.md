+ A game can only have one publisher. 
+ Games should have title, rating (from users), age groups (ex: 2-5; 5 - 8; etc), description, min - max number of possible players, date of published and URL to the game page. 
+ A publisher should have name, address, phone number and can publish multiple games.
+ The website allows users to register as members
+ A member should have username, password, email, age.
+ A member can rate a game and should be remembered by the system.
+ A member can add a game to his/her favorite list.
+ The system should keep track of games that a member has played. 

Design such database. Use SQL to insert in at least 20 rows for each tables. 
Optionally, write a program allows people to view the list of games, search games by categories or show favorite list.
